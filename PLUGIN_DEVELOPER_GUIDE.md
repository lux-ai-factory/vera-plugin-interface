# Plugin Developer Guide

This guide is for developers who want to implement evaluation plugins.
The goal is to explain the contract exposed to plugin authors, clarify the current extension points, and make it easier to identify which additional hooks would be useful.

## 1. Purpose

The system is built around a plugin model in which evaluation logic is implemented outside the core application and loaded dynamically at runtime.

A plugin author should be able to:

- define configuration as typed data
- parse datasets and models into domain-specific objects
- execute evaluation logic
- emit structured measurements
- report progress during long-running work
- optionally influence host-specific integration behavior through extra hooks

The core question behind this guide is not how to use the surrounding platform, but whether the plugin contract is expressive enough for real evaluation workloads.

## 2. Architecture Overview

At a high level, the architecture has four moving parts:

- a **plugin project** that contains one or more plugin classes
- an **interface package** that defines the base classes and shared models
- a **plugin loader** that discovers and imports plugin packages
- one or more **host runtimes** that instantiate plugins for discovery, validation, or execution

The same plugin can be loaded in more than one context. In the current reference implementation, one runtime imports plugins to inspect metadata and configuration, while another runtime imports them to execute evaluation jobs.

## 3. Discovery Model

Plugins are discovered from a configured root directory. The loader scans each top-level folder in that directory and looks for a Python package in one of these layouts.

### `src` layout

```text
my-plugin-project/
├── pyproject.toml
└── src/
    └── my_plugin/
        ├── __init__.py
        └── plugin.py
```

### Direct package layout

```text
my-plugin-project/
├── pyproject.toml
└── my_plugin/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── plugin.py
```

The package must export the plugin class from `__init__.py`. The loader imports the package and registers every class that inherits from `BaseEvaluationPlugin`.

Important details:

- the exposed plugin name is the Python class name, for example `MyPlugin`
- the project folder name and package name do not have to match
- any import error during discovery prevents the plugin from being registered

## 4. Local Development Assumptions

The current reference setup expects a plugin root directory mounted into the runtimes that load plugins. A typical local arrangement looks like this:

```text
/absolute/path/to/plugins/
└── my-plugin-project/
```

As long as the host runtime points its plugin search path at `/absolute/path/to/plugins`, the plugin can be discovered.

You do not need to understand the surrounding platform to implement a plugin, but you do need to know two practical constraints:

- your project must live under the configured plugin root
- both the discovery runtime and the execution runtime must be able to import the package

## 5. Creating a Plugin Project

Create a new project in your plugin workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p /absolute/path/to/plugins
cd /absolute/path/to/plugins
mkdir my-aisc-plugin
cd my-aisc-plugin
uv init --lib
uv add git+https://github.com/lux-ai-factory/aisc-plugin-interface
```

Recommended structure:

```text
my-aisc-plugin/
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── src/
│   └── my_aisc_plugin/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── plugin.py
└── uv.lock
```

## 6. Core Contract

Every plugin must inherit from `BaseEvaluationPlugin[T]`, where `T` is a Pydantic model representing plugin configuration.

The core contract is centered around these capabilities:

- `evaluate(config_data)`: main execution logic
- `validate_config_form_data(config_form_data)`: validates incoming configuration against your typed model
- `@metric("...")`: marks metric export methods
- `export_metrics(...)`: runs all metric exporters and aggregates their `Measure` outputs
- `set_dataset_input_provider(file_content)`: optional dataset parsing hook
- `set_model_input_provider(file_content)`: optional model parsing hook
- `report_progress(TaskProgress(...))`: optional progress reporting hook

These pieces are sufficient for the basic plugin lifecycle:

1. receive configuration
2. parse input artifacts
3. execute evaluation logic
4. emit measurements

## 7. Minimal Example

This example reads a CSV dataset and computes two aggregate metrics.

### `src/my_aisc_plugin/plugin.py`

```python
from typing import Any

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from aisc_plugin_interface import BaseEvaluationPlugin, Measure, TaskProgress, metric
from aisc_plugin_interface.input_providers.csv_input_provider import CsvInputProvider


class ConfigSchema(BaseModel):
    score_column: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Name of the CSV column containing numeric scores.",
    )
    threshold: float = Field(
        default=0.5,
        ge=0.0,
        le=1.0,
        description="Scores greater than or equal to this value count as passing.",
    )


class ExampleCsvPlugin(BaseEvaluationPlugin[ConfigSchema]):
    def set_dataset_input_provider(self, file_content: bytes | None):
        if file_content is None:
            raise ValueError("This plugin requires a dataset file")
        self.dataset_input_provider = CsvInputProvider(file_content)
        return self.dataset_input_provider

    def evaluate(self, config_data: dict) -> Any:
        config = self.validate_config_form_data(config_data)
        rows = self.get_dataset()

        scores: list[float] = []
        total_rows = len(rows)

        for index, row in enumerate(rows):
            raw_value = row.get(config.score_column)
            if raw_value is None or raw_value == "":
                continue

            scores.append(float(raw_value))

            if total_rows:
                self.report_progress(
                    TaskProgress(
                        progress=(index + 1) / total_rows,
                        extra={"rows_processed": index + 1},
                    )
                )

        passing = [score for score in scores if score >= config.threshold]

        return {
            "average_score": (sum(scores) / len(scores)) if scores else 0.0,
            "pass_rate": (len(passing) / len(scores)) if scores else 0.0,
        }

    @metric("Average score")
    def average_score_metric(self, evaluation_output: dict) -> list[Measure]:
        return [
            Measure(
                name="Average score",
                score=float(evaluation_output["average_score"]),
            )
        ]

    @metric("Pass rate")
    def pass_rate_metric(self, evaluation_output: dict) -> list[Measure]:
        return [
            Measure(
                name="Pass rate",
                score=float(evaluation_output["pass_rate"]),
                unit="ratio",
            )
        ]
```

### `src/my_aisc_plugin/__init__.py`

```python
from .plugin import ExampleCsvPlugin

__all__ = ["ExampleCsvPlugin"]
```

## 8. Configuration as Typed Data

Plugin configuration is defined as a Pydantic model.

That gives you:

- explicit configuration structure
- validation rules close to the plugin implementation
- a single source of truth for default values and constraints

Example:

```python
class ConfigSchema(BaseModel):
    threshold: float = Field(default=0.5, ge=0.0, le=1.0)
```

Inside `evaluate`, validate incoming configuration before using it:

```python
config = self.validate_config_form_data(config_data)
```

Even if the host application also validates configuration, the plugin should treat validated config as the boundary between transport data and business logic.

## 9. Input Parsing

The plugin base class separates raw input delivery from parsed input consumption.

If your plugin needs a dataset, override `set_dataset_input_provider`.

If your plugin needs a model artifact, override `set_model_input_provider`.

The base class provides:

- `get_dataset()`: returns parsed dataset data
- `get_model()`: returns parsed model data

### Built-in CSV provider

The interface package includes `CsvInputProvider`, which turns CSV bytes into `list[dict]`.

Example:

```python
def set_dataset_input_provider(self, file_content: bytes | None):
    if file_content is None:
        raise ValueError("Dataset required")
    self.dataset_input_provider = CsvInputProvider(file_content)
    return self.dataset_input_provider
```

### Custom input providers

If you need another format, create a subclass of `BaseInputProvider`.

```python
from aisc_plugin_interface.input_providers.base_input_provider import BaseInputProvider


class JsonInputProvider(BaseInputProvider):
    def _read_data(self, file_content: bytes):
        import json
        return json.loads(file_content.decode("utf-8"))
```

This design keeps parsing logic out of `evaluate` and makes it easier to test input handling independently.

## 10. Metrics and Measurements

The `evaluate` method may return any intermediate object. That object is then passed to each method decorated with `@metric`.

Metric methods must return `list[Measure]`.

`Measure` contains:

- `name`
- `description`
- `unit`
- `score`
- `time`
- `error`
- `feature_pid`

One plugin can export one metric or many metrics. This separation is useful because it lets the evaluation step produce a shared intermediate result and keeps metric extraction methods small and focused.

Example:

```python
@metric("Accuracy")
def accuracy_metric(self, evaluation_output) -> list[Measure]:
    ...


@metric("F1")
def f1_metric(self, evaluation_output) -> list[Measure]:
    ...
```

## 11. Progress Reporting

Long-running plugins can report progress during evaluation.

Use:

```python
self.report_progress(TaskProgress(progress=0.25, extra={"stage": "loading"}))
```

Rules:

- `progress` must be between `0.0` and `1.0`
- `extra` may contain plugin-defined metadata
- progress reporting is optional

Do not override `_set_progress_callback`; that is managed by the execution runtime.

## 12. Optional Integration Hooks

The core plugin model is small, but the base class also exposes several optional hooks that are integration-oriented rather than strictly evaluation-oriented.

These hooks are important because they reveal where the architecture already allows extension and where future hooks may be needed.

### `on_config_change`

This hook receives incomplete or partially edited configuration and can return:

- updated config data
- updated schema
- updated UI schema

It is useful for dynamic configuration, conditional fields, and derived defaults.

From a pure plugin-architecture perspective, this hook can be read more generally as:

- a way to react to evolving configuration state
- a place to derive secondary configuration fields
- a place to resolve configuration against partially known inputs

### `parse_config_from_dataset`

This hook attempts to infer configuration from the current dataset.

It is useful when configuration depends on data shape, column names, task type, or metadata inferred from the dataset.

From an extensibility perspective, this suggests a broader family of possible hooks:

- infer config from model artifacts
- infer config from project metadata
- infer config from external registries or schemas

### `get_metric_visualizations`

This hook returns visualization metadata associated with exported metrics.

It is not part of the core evaluation algorithm, but it is currently the way a plugin can communicate preferred result structure to a host application.

If the goal is to keep the plugin contract implementation-focused, this hook can be treated as optional integration metadata rather than a required plugin concern.

### `feature_flags`

This hook exposes plugin-specific capabilities to the host application.

At the moment it is mostly used for host-specific behavior, but the pattern is potentially useful for broader capability negotiation between plugin and runtime.

### `display_icon`

This hook is entirely presentation-oriented. It is useful only if the host application wants plugins to contribute presentation metadata.

If the document should remain strictly focused on implementation concerns, this hook is peripheral.

The easiest way to test a plugin is to decouple the concerns.
